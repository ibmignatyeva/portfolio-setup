          Ive has her academic background in Tourism and has always been
          passionate about solving problems in a clear, objective, and balanced
          way so that they positively impact the final customer experience. She
          has more than 15 years of experience in B2C customer relationships and
          service, in addition to sales from prospecting to closing deals and
          customer support. 👩🏼‍🎓
           </p> 
          <p>Her passion for learning and facing new
          challenges led her to the world of technology, and since July/2022 she
          has been fully dedicated to online courses in the area of Front-End
          Development, using self-management, organization, and autonomy, to
          seek constant improvement and satisfy her eagerness for knowledge, so
          she can utilize technology to empower businesses as a Jr. Front-End
          Developer or a Junior Front-End Engineer. 👩‍💻 </p>
          <p>  Her foundation has been
          built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, Api ’s, Bootstrap,
          Hosting, and she is adding more and more knowledge to her baggage.
          After all, it's never too late to (re)start and learn! 📚🚀 </p>
          <p>  Due to
          past experiences in international companies and home-office, and her
          fluency in languages such as Spanish, English, and basic Russian, she
          has developed an excellent ability to communicate with different types
          of people and audiences, as well as working for the growth of her team
          and her company, in an organized way and committed to achieving the
          best results.🎯🗺 </p>
